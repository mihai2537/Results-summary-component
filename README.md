## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first approach

### What I learned

- You cannot add a transition directly to a background image. In our scenario this was the gradient used on the button.
- Sometimes it is a good idea to decrease the opacity of the background color, you could get nice effects.
